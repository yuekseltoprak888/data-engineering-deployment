##  Deploying to cloud run

We want to deploy our api inside our container to cloud run so that the cloud runs the container for us! Cloud Run on GCP allows you to deploy containerized applications in a fully managed environment. You package your code in a Docker container, upload it to GCP, and Cloud Run handles scaling, load balancing, and HTTPS. It abstracts away infrastructure management, letting you focus on code.

### Deployment

1. Setup your `.env` here you can duplicate the `.env.example` and rename it to `.env` and fill in the `DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME`! Pick a name which pushes to the artifact registry you setup before!

2. Setup the makefile with the following commands:

```makefile
build_docker_image:
    build the container using DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME

run_docker_image:
    run the container using DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME

push_docker_image:
    push the container using DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME
```

For run_docker_image make sure you can access the api on localhost:8000!

3. For cloud run we can't just hardcode the port so add a `PORT` variable to the `.env` file and use it in the Dockerfile! Also update the run command in the makefile to use the `PORT` variable! Passing it as an environment variable in the run command.

In makefile
```
-e PORT=$(PORT)
```

In dockerfile
```
CMD uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

</details>

4.

Add one last command to the makefile

```
deploy_docker_image:
    deploy
```

Using https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/run/deploy  make sure to allow unauthenticated invocations so you can access your class mates apis!

## üèÅ Finished

We have now set up a very basic deployment but we want to add ci and cd in our next exercise in order to establish best practices!
